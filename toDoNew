3.
Steps to Continue:
	•	Step 1: Address the immediate areas mentioned above.
	•	Update the checkOutBook() method.
	•	Rename methods in Library class.
	•	Initialize borrowedBooks in Client class.
	•	Step 2: Enhance the Library class.
	•	Add methods to add/remove clients.
	•	Implement a search functionality for books.
	•	Step 3: Extend borrowing & returning functionalities.
	•	Allow a Client to borrow and return books via the Library class. The Library will serve as the mediator between Book and Client.
	•	Step 4: Add more functionalities as needed.
	•	List all borrowed books.
	•	List all available books.
	•	Search for clients.
	•	Generate reports like "most borrowed book", "active clients", etc.
	•	Step 5: Implement a user interface (UI) or a simple menu system in the Main class for the user to interact with your system if desired. This will let you test drive your system in real scenarios.
	•		•	Step 6: Continuously test. After every significant change, test your system to ensure it behaves as expected.
	•	Step 7: Comment and document. Ensure each class and method is well-commented to make future visits to the code easier.
